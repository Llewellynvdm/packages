# JCB! Libraries

### What Are JCB Libraries?
JCB Libraries are **JavaScript and CSS frontend resources** (such as Bootstrap, UIkit, Font Awesome, etc.)  
used inside Joomla components built with Joomla Component Builder (JCB).  

They are part of the **media system** — loaded dynamically via Joomla's asset manager into:

- **Site Views**
- **Custom Admin Views**
- **Templates**
- **Layouts**

You define how the library behaves, where its files come from (local/CDN), and when they should load.  
JCB takes care of all the boilerplate required for correct Joomla asset registration — per Joomla version.

### Why Use Libraries in JCB?
With JCB Libraries, you can:

- Automatically inject JS/CSS files into views/templates/layouts
- Avoid manually writing Joomla's asset inclusion logic
- Set **smart load conditions** (always, only once, etc.)
- Choose between **local file copies** or **CDN URLs**
- Package and version-control libraries across multiple components

This system removes the burden of asset management, so you can focus on functionality.

### How Do Libraries Integrate into JCB?
From the JCB GUI, navigate to the **Libraries** area to manage inclusion logic and files.

To import libraries from this repository:

1. Click **Init** in the Libraries section
2. Select the repository you want to pull from
3. Choose one or more libraries to import

Once imported, you can:

- **Link a library** to a layout, template, or view
- **Set inclusion strategy** (e.g. "always include", "only in layout")
- **Reset** a library to refresh from this repository
- **Push** updates back if you have write access (or use a fork)

Each library entry defines how its files are bundled, loaded, and reused across JCB.

### Customization & Repository Support
Libraries are version-controlled and support the full Git workflow.

You can:

- Fork this repository and point your JCB instance to your fork
- Use your own CDN URLs or host files locally via JCB's download system
- Push contributions or improvements using Pull Requests

This gives you **full control and flexibility** over how your frontend libraries are included in your Joomla components.
